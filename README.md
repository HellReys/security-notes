# Security Notes

This repository contains my personal cybersecurity notes, lab write ups, and technical reflections based on **hands on experiments, personal learning, and independent analysis**.

The focus is not on tool usage or exploit copy pasting, but on understanding **how and why attacks work**, what design or configuration mistakes enable them, and **how they could be detected or prevented** from a defensive and architectural perspective.

Most of the content here is derived from my own lab environments and learning process as a cybersecurity student, combining both **offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team)** viewpoints.

## Scope and Focus Areas

The topics covered in this repository mainly include:

- Active Directory and identity-based attack paths  
- Windows internals relevant to security (tokens, authentication, credential access)  
- Detection engineering fundamentals (logs, signals, basic detection logic)  
- Security architecture considerations and misconfiguration patterns  
- Lab-based attack and detection experiments

## How the Notes Are Structured

Most write-ups follow a consistent thought process:

1. Description of the scenario or problem  
2. Attack path or technical behavior observed  
3. Why it works (root cause analysis)  
4. Relevant logs, telemetry, or signals  
5. Detection ideas or architectural mitigations  
6. Personal takeaways and lessons learned  

The goal is to document **thinking**, not just results.

## Learning Philosophy

These notes reflect my belief that strong security comes from:
- Understanding systems deeply, not just breaking them  
- Thinking like an attacker while designing defenses  
- Questioning defaults, assumptions, and “best practices”  

Whenever possible, I try to connect offensive techniques with defensive visibility and long term security design decisions.

## Disclaimer

All experiments and scenarios documented here are performed in **isolated lab environments** and are intended **for educational and research purposes only**.

## Work in Progress

This repository is a living document and will continue to evolve as my understanding grows.
